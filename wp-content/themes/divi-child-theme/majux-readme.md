Instructions for the Majux Custom Child Theme (Divi Child)
Client: Ken Kieklak
==========================================================

All Layouts are saved to Divi > Divi Library

Load the layouts by clicking "Load From Library" on the backend of your desired page.

Load sections by clicking "Add from Library" under any section in the backend of any page.

After you load your desired layout, you will need to pick "Fullscreen Layout" and pick "Right Sidebar" from the dropdown, in the top-right corner of the backend of any page. 

For 2nd tier sub pages (practice areas, menu pages), you will need to load "KKL Sub Page Layout"

For 3nd tier sub pages (most basic pages), you will need to load "KKL Sub Sub Page Layout", this will load a post header and text box. You will still need to enable the sidebar and layout type (fullscreen).

Other Rules:
============

Always try to use page builder (accept for posts)
Never use "Enable Visual Builder" fromt he divi admin bar, or it will break the layout and styles.
